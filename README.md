# Book-Emporium


As part of my software development journey, I conceptualized, designed, and implemented a Library Management System using the Tkinter library. This project allowed me to understand and develop my skills on user interface design, data management, and software architecture. The Library Management System was aimed to maintain book details in easier and simpler way.

User-friendly Interface: 
                        I crafted an user interface utilizing Tkinter's GUI components, ensuring ease of use for librarians and bookstore owners. The interface featured well-organized sections for searching , adding and managing books

Searching , Adding and Managing books:
                      I connected main python file to a backend file which then was connected to a database using SQLite , each function was done using SQL quries and connecting it to main file by importing backend file in main file.

Achievements:

Reduced book search time by implementing an efficient search algorithm.
Easy addition , deletion as well as updation of books details.
